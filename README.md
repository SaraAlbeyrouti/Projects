Noting down Project Ideas I want to implement so I don't forget and track over time 

1. Audience: Decision-fatigued people during decluttering or moving. The app works by  you taking a picture of an item( or choosing from a category or searching it up) and it recognizes it. The app then asks you questions for personalized decision making. The app also gives you wisdom about decluttering and minimalism methods implemented from around the world.ANDDD tells you the nearest donation or recycling center based on your location using an API. technology i would use: Tensorflow for image detection ( or use a pretrained image classifier like Google's?) , Flutter, Python dictionary for the  decision tree ( or an NLP), google map API
